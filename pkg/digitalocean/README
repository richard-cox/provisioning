# Example Provisioner for the Digital Ocean Node Driver

This is example of how an extension can use the hooks in IClusterProvisioner with an existing provider. It assists in providing a more end-to-end test of clusters created using this process rather than an example of good practise. It does not cover how machine config schemas and the like are created or managed.
